## Marine Species

This project includes Python code for **web scrapping** data of two similar websites at the same time, and store them in a csv file. The result csv is also provided.

After the collection of data, an [exploratory data analysis](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Deffro/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/Marine-Species/2.%20Marine%20Species%20Analysis.ipynb) is made (work in progress).
