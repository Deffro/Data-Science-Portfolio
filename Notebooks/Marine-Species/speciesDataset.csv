Known lake populations from Morocco and Portugal need access to rivers to spawn (Refs.  10536 , 89647, 89648). Larvae and small juveniles inhabit deep slow-flowing areas of rivers, some swimming upstream in late summer and autumn. Juveniles (up to 1+ years) are usually found near estuaries or river mouths (Refs.  10536 ,  59043 ), possibly making vertical diurnal movements synchronized with the tides; they remain in estuaries for over one year. Feeds on a wide range of planktonic crustaceans; larger adults feed on small schooling fishes . Juveniles in freshwater prey on insect larvae.

They ascend rivers in April and May when water temperature is 9-12 C, peaking at 13-16 C. Adults may migrate up to 700 km from the sea into major rivers and occasionally into the largest tributaries of these rivers to spawn. Males migrate upriver at 3-9 years; females first reproduce 1-3 years later than males. Gametogenesis occurs during spawning migration. Males arrive first in the upper reaches and occupy appropriate spawning sites, with females arriving 1-2 weeks later. Spawning sites are usually shallow areas (<1.5 m depth) of rivers near a confluence  with strong currents and clean gravel bottoms (Refs.  188 ,  10536 ,  59043 ). Spawning occurs at night (over several nights), in large and very noisy schools that form near the surface.when water temperature reaches at least 15 C and is believed to be optimal between 22-24 C.. Coupling happens side by side, thrashing caudal fins on water surface and swimming in circles while expulsing eggs and sperms in the surrounding water. Eggs are fertilized in mid-water and then sink to the gravel bottom. Eggs hatch after 4-8 days (22-24 C). After spawning, adults return to the sea but many die before reaching it . Only 5-6 % of the adults spawn more than once in their lifetime. After 3-4 months juveniles (8-12 cm length) move towards the sea until mature.

Enter estuaries and ascend rivers in May and June when water temperature is between 10-14 C (Refs.  188 , 51442,  59043 , 89636). Males begin such movements at 2-3 years, females at 3-4 years. Although movement upstream is usually limited to a few kilometres above the brackish zone (Refs.  59043 , 89486), spawning has also been reported in non-tidal freshwater areas up to 400 km upstream. Gametogenesis occurs in the estuaries. Early arrivals in the rivers are mostly males, with the sex ratio becoming more equal with the later arrivals. Spawning movements occur with spring tides and peak when river discharge levels are high (Refs. 89636, 89638). However, when flows are too high, movements upstream become limited (Refs. 89636, 89639). Spawn when water temperature is anywhere between 12-22 C. Move to riverine spawning grounds at night; spawn in large, very noisy schools near surface and leave these areas before daybreak. Spawning sites consist of sand and gravel areas with flowing water. Spent adults return to the sea and may spawn for 3-4 seasons throughout their lifetime (Refs. 30578, 51442,  59043 ). Most individuals will have lost 22 % of their body weight after spawning. There is some evidence that most individuals return to their natal rivers to spawn (Refs.  10541 ,  59043 ). Eggs either drift with the current or sink to the bottom .

Territorial and solitary species; 'schools' of young eels which are observed from time to time are a mass response to outward conditions and not of active assembling. Amphihaline. Migrates to the depths of the Sargasso Sea to spawn . Eel larvae (leptocephali) are transparent ribbon-like. They are brought to the coasts of Europe by the Gulf Stream in 7 to 11 months time and can last for up to 3 years. They are transformed into glass eels (6-8 cm length, cylindrical in shape and transparent to slightly pigmented in colour). They enter the estuaries and colonize rivers and lakes ; some individuals remain in estuaries and coastal waters to grow into adults. The glass eel stage is followed by a long feeding period (from the yellow to the silver eel stage) lasting 6-12 years in males and 9-20 years in females. Yellow and silver eels are benthic, found under stones, buried in the mud or in crevices. Yellow eels eventually lose their pigmentation, becoming dark dorsally and silver ventrally (called silver eels). Silver eels are also characterized by a clear contrasting black lateral line and enlarged eyes. At the end of their growth period, they become sexually mature, migrate to the sea and cover great distances during their spawning migration (5,000-6,000 km); with extensive daily vertical migrations between 200 m at night and 600 m during day time, possibly for predator avoidance. Gametogenesis occurs entirely during spawning migration. Average life span is usually 15-20 years. Male eels can grow up to 50 cm TL. Occurs at temperatures ranging from 0-30C. Its food includes virtually the whole aquatic fauna (freshwater as well as marine) occurring in the eel's area, augmented with animals living out of water, e.g. worms. Best temperature for making eels sexually mature is 20-25C. Sensitive to weak magnetic fields . Their high fat content and benthic feeding habits in continental waters make them vulnerable to the bioaccumulation of pollutants, such as heavy metals and organic contaminants, that may result in organ damage and impaired migration capability and lowered genetic variability. Review of information supports the view that the European eel population as a whole has declined in most areas, the stock is outside safe biological limits and current fisheries not sustainable. Obvious decreasing of the stocks for all the continental native distribution area. Utilized fresh, dried or salted, smoked and frozen; can be fried, boiled and baked.","Catadromous species.

In the North Atlantic, paralarvae are particularly abundant from May to August and in February; in the Mediterranean and in upwelling areas off northwestern Africa between 10N and 30N, from April to July, September, and from December to February.
Paralarvae and juveniles are epipelagic to mesopelagic, then undergo ontogenetic descent to mesopelagic and bathypelagic zones as adults. In the western Atlantic (approximately 39N 72W) paralarvae, juveniles and subadults were captured in slope
and eddy water masses at 43 to 750 m, with paralarvae and juveniles at less than 300 m and adults greater than 300 m; diurnal vertical migration was indicated. Off Hawaii specimens were caught in closing nets at 830 to 975 m during day and 100 to 150 m
at night; open net captures were made at 975 to 1 000 m in daytime and at 50 and 250 m at night.

The males did not become interested in the female until she slowed, moved to the sand area and started cupping her pelvic fins. The two males then became competitive toward each other, circling and tailing, until the alpha male forced the beta male out of the sand area. The female bit the male prior to copulation. She exhibited shielding behavior for several days and then resumed cupping and flaring. The female gradually changed her swimming position and began displaying the submissive behavior. The alpha male swam in increasingly larger circles and began splaying its claspers, then approached the female and exhibited tailing and nosing. Copulation occurred as the male bit into the right flank and trailing edge of the pectoral fin of the female. The male swam side by side with the female, copulating with the right clasper for one to two minutes. After copulation, the male showed little interest in the female."" In captivity, males show aggression toward other species after copulation . Females avoid patrolling males by 'shielding' with pelvics close to the substrate .

They are observed to reposition themselves in a particular area on a daily basis to take advantage of thermal hotspots within a highly dynamic thermal environment .  Diving behavior of loggerheads on seabed and pelagically mid-water is observed for travel and foraging during their inter-nesting interval; there is a preference of mid-water resting during travel with a seabed alternative to conserve its resources.  This behavior is observed to be locally adapted .  Aggressive behavior between females has 4 stages (1) initial contact:  once intruders entered the visual range of residents, (2) passive confrontation:  wide head-tail circling maintaining a distance of 1.5 m, (3) aggressive confrontation:  starts when a turtle stops circling to face the other head-on; then sparring starts wherein they snap at each others' jaws while holding defensive horizontal positions in the water column; it progresses to close circling and snapping at the posterior carapace and/or flippers of the other followed by chasing and snapping at the neck and/or central carapace, and (4) separation:  may be mutual wherein they swim in opposite directions or may involve a brief chasing of the other out of the vicinity.

A typical solitary nektonic animal which usually feeds at shallow water areas where seagrasses or algae is abundant .  Feeds on algae and seagrasses .  Home ranges for individuals feeding on algae is larger than individuals feeding on seagrass .  Adults are known to be herbivorous while hatchlings to juvenile sizes are assumed to be carnivorous which has faster growth rates.  When they get big enough, mostly capable of avoiding predators, they shift to a herbivorous diet .  Adults spend their adult life in foraging grounds which is often in great distance from nesting grounds .  This results in a great energy cost from transport and fasting during the travel, thus females are observed to rest on the sea floor between nestings .  Since mating occurs at sea, courting and copulation behavior are observed near nesting beaches and males are described to display and elaborate courtship behavior .  In Hawaii beach-basking behavior was observed to facilitate temperature regulation .  They have a swimming speed of 32km/hr .  During nesting, females emerge from the water and creates a set of tracks one ascending to a successful nest or aborted digging while another extends as it descends to the sea .  Post-nesting behavior shows a dominance of short dives mainly during open-ocean migration.  This aids them in lessening their energy cost during transport, plus there is little food available in the open-ocean thus close to surface dives is observed.

Mating system of green turtles is called scramble polygamy, which is when males competitively search for receptive females.

Their secondary sexual characteristic is a longer prehensile tail with terminal nail, larger, recurved claws on the front flippers and a soft, more concave plastra (Refs. 85357, 85358).  This characteristic is important for successful mounting in the face of intrasexual agonism, which is common for this species .  Sexual dimorphism also exists for this species, males being a smaller size and females being larger.

Adults mainly feed on pelagic invertebrates, e.g., jellyfishes, tunicates, crustaceans and juvenile fishes.  In some places it is used as bait for long line shark fisheries but this species have no commercial fisheries , although pelagic fisheries has been identified as a major source of its mortality .  An example of this is the 1.4 million hooks deployed in the Atlantic daily .  Declining populations have been reported in the Pacific .  For conservation purposes, breeding interval between regions is important to note.  The interval is generally longer in the Pacific than in the Atlantic and can be up to 7 years .

This is known to have a wide range of foraging area in the open ocean , wherein ocean currents take part in.  Deepest dive is recorded at 1,230 m.  Residence of this species is related to enhanced prey availability in a particular area .  This is supported by data showing shallow near surface day and night diel dive patterns of leatherbacks in relation to their zooplankton prey exhibiting diel vertical migration that are both observed in high latitudes of the Atlantic and the tropics.

A large bibliography is available at www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hall/1345/stickbibl.html.","Spawning behavior is similar for both freshwater and anadromous forms. Just before breeding, males become very territorial. The male builds a nest of plant-material glued together with spiggin, a protein produced in the kidney. Once a nest is built, the male entices the female into the nest by performing a courtship dance which is a series of  zigzag movements. A receptive female follows the male who points the opening of the nest by posing above it with his head down. The female enters the nest, deposits up to a few hundred eggs, and is driven out by the male after eggs have been deposited. The male then enters the nest to fertilize the eggs. The male can choose to court another female to enter the nest and lay eggs before entering himself to fertilise the deposited eggs. Females may lay eggs in several nests over a period of several days or may be courted by the same male. The male guards and ventilates the eggs and young.  During spawning season, males develop a bright orange to red belly and blue-green flank and eyes.  Eggs hatch in 7-8 days.  Anadromous forms usually die of exhaustion after spawning cycle.

Threats to this species are dynamite and cyanide fishing, pollution, and intrusion of foreign commercial fishing vessels , unregulated fishing activities of Taiwanese vessels, i.e. long-line and drift net fishing, and unconfirmed reports of pirate whaling .  There were nine distinctive themes of humpback whale songs identified wherein 7 of which were common in the Philippines and Hawaii . Feeds and breeds in coastal waters, often near human population centres, and this helps make them one of the most familiar of the large whales.  They migrate from tropics (breeding areas) to polar or sub-polar regions, reaching the ice edges in both hemispheres (feeding areas); their migrations take them through oceanic zones.  Feeds on krill and small schooling fish .

Adults are found on slopes adjacent to deep water where they come in for shelter and for seeking cleaner fishes.  They are usually shy. However, they may become familiar with divers in some locations.  Individuals often drift at the surface while lying on its side but can swim actively and are capable of directional movements otherwise. They swim upright and close to the surface. The dorsal fin often protrudes above the water.  Females are larger than males. This species has been filmed in 480 m depth with the help of a camera equipped with baits (Lis Maclaren, pers. comm. 2005).  Adults eat fishes, mollusks, zooplankton, jellyfish, crustaceans and brittle stars .  A live colony of the cirripede  Lepas anatifera  were found attached to the anterior portion of the sunfish's esophagus that was stranded in the south coast of Terceira Island, Azores Archipelago in 2004.  This association has apparent advantages for the goose barnacles such as a regular intake of food and protection both from hydrodynamic hazards and from predators: but for the sunfish, it is not clear whether it is neutral, of advantage or causes feeding problems since the attachment may obstruct the sunfish's esophagus.  The sunfish is registered as the heaviest bony fish and as the one with the most eggs in the Guinness Book of World Records.  Generally this species is not used as food fish; some people consider it as a delicacy.  The fish can be utilized fresh and can be broiled.  Some parts of the fish are used in Chinese medicine.

Dispersal distances, as influenced by the currents, estimated to be more than 10 km.  Life span estimated at 20 to 30 years. A human food source since the Stone Age.  German North Sea populations decline began in the late 18th century and attributed to the use of steam ships in oyster fishery; and since the 1950s to 2012, is considered extinct in German waters.  Identified hindrance to recolonization include anthropogenic influences such as overfishing and unregulated fishing; presence of invasive species and eutrophication linked to aquaculture; habitat-altering and destructive marine construction activities; poisoning from oil spills and from the liquid biocide, tributyltin hydride, in anti-fouling marine paint used in commercial shipping; as well as temperature and osmotic stress due to climate change .

Occupies a wide range of streams and habitats. Larvae are found in streams with summer flows 0.03-4,400 m3/s and summer water temperatures 10-26.1 C. Relatively abundant in cool, pool-riffle streams with sand-gravel substrate, high water quality and stable flows, but is also tolerant of fluctuating flows. In Michigan, ammocoetes have been reported in lentic habitats up to 450 m from the presumed originating stream, at water depths 1-16 m, where substrates vary from sand-silt, with or without detritus, to gravel-rubble-sand. Feeding adults of permanent freshwater populations can be found in small to large lakes and large rivers and, in the case of anadromous populations, in small to large rivers and in the ocean. In the ocean, it occurs both pelagically and benthically, possibly to a depth of 4,099 m. Spawning adults can be found in creeks or lake inlets.  Amphihaline species making important migrations. Spends its adult life in the sea for about 20-36 months, moving further offshore as it grows. Adults are parasitic, using their sharp teeth to attach themselves to cetaceans and large fish and feed off their hosts blood, body fluids and flesh for several days, usually without killing the host. An anticoagulant substance prevents the blood of the prey from clotting. Mature adults enter rivers and streams to spawn in spring . Movements from the sea to spawning sites may cover distances from 20-850 km inland. After spawning adults normally die. Ammocoetes drift downstream and bury in detritus-rich mud, silt or sand-silt bottoms  for 5.5-8 years, often at the edges of rivers and streams where currents are slow .  Duration of larval life is usually a minimum of 5 yrs, but has been reported as short as 2 years and as long as 19 or more years.  Ammocoetes are filter feeders of diatoms and detritus . Upon metamorphosis, individuals move downstream towards the sea. Juveniles remain in the estuaries and shallow coastal areas for a feeding period lasting 23-28 months, during which they grow from ca. 4 to 900 g . Most individuals attain 60-75 cm length. Duration of adult life in anadromous populations approximately two years. Metamorphosis occurs in July-October, but has been reported as early as April, in Michigan.  Adults are parasitic on marine and freshwater fishes, and marine mammals. Multiple attachments can occur (e.g., 3 on  Cetorhinus maximus , 2-3 on  Urophycis chuss ). Adults are preyed upon by Porbeagle Sharks in northwestern Atlantic waters. Feeding migrations in landlocked parasitic adults in the Laurentian Great Lakes can reach 628 km. They may not only feed on dead or netted fish, but also attach themselves to healthy fish. The landlocked form is very destructive to freshwater fishes and occasionally annoys bathers by clinging to them. In Michigan, the spawning period is from 27 May to 2 September, at water temperatures between 11.1-26.1 C, with peak spawning activity in late May to mid-June. In Ontario, nest building occurs from 4 to 21 June at water temperatures 18-23 C. In Qubec and New York streams spawning also occurs in June, but in New York lakes spawning is from the end of May to the beginning of July. Nests are built in streams having 1.5-43 m width, 15-90 cm depth, and 0.01-54 m3/s flow. Up to ten spawning lampreys have been found in a nest. Fecundity, 43,997-101,932 [up to 108,000 according to Gage (1928)] eggs/female in landlocked populations and 151,836-304,832 eggs/female in anadromous populations. There are reported occurrences in Michigan of communal spawning of Sea Lamprey with Chestnut Lamprey (Pine, Platte, and Muskegon rivers), of Sea Lamprey with Northern Brook Lamprey (Devils River), of Sea Lamprey with Silver Lamprey (Carp Lake, Devils, East Au Gres, and Rifle rivers), of Sea Lamprey with American Brook Lamprey (Carp Lake, Pine and Pentwater rivers), of Sea Lamprey with American Brook Lamprey and Chestnut Lamprey (Betsie River), and of Sea Lamprey with American Brook Lamprey and Silver Lamprey (Carp Lake).  Invaded the upper Laurentian Great Lakes (Huron-Michigan-Superior) in the late 1930s, where it contributed to some extent to the collapse of the Lake Trout and various cisco ( Coregonus johannae ,  C. nigripinnis , and  C. zenithicus ) fisheries. The fishes that did not die directly from the lamprey attacks or indirectly from secondary fungal infection had reduced market value because of the unsightly wounds. Splake, a fast-growing hybrid between Brook Trout and Lake Trout was developed specifically in response to the effect of Sea Lamprey on Lake Trout. Overfishing was also a major consideration in the demise of Lake Trout populations and Gilbertson (1992) has suggested that another contributing factor would be the extreme sensitivity of eggs and sac fry of this species to a persistent dioxin-like PCB isomer that was probably present in the Great Lakes by the 1930s and resulted in its reduced reproductive success. Sea Lamprey has been targeted by control measures in the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin that include lampricide treatments (3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol, abbreviated as TFM, with or without the synergist 2,5-dichloro-4-nitrosalicylanilide, abbreviated as Bayer 73) aimed at ammocoetes, beginning in 1957, electromechanical barriers that intercept upstream migrants, beginning before 1957, and later low-head barriers, adjustable-crest barriers, also known as inflatable barriers, traps, and chemosterilization of males. Approximately 258,000 adult Sea Lamprey, were taken between 1953 and 1960 at electrical barriers operated in Lake Superior Basin alone. Between 1958 and 1980, 54.5 million Canadian dollars where spent for Sea Lamprey control and research. Despite some attempts at developing a fishery oriented towards ethnic communities in large cities around the Great Lakes such as Toronto, a fishery for landlocked Sea Lamprey has not become established. Additionally, high levels of mercury in adults preclude their use for human consumption. Historical fisheries for the anadromous form existed in the 1800s on the Merrimack and Connecticut rivers, Massachusetts, when it was abundant, before dams and pollution. Such fisheries have existed for centuries in Europe [England (UK), France, Portugal]. Recipes include Lamproie  la bordelaise, which involves cooking in red wine. There are reports of intoxication through eating this species (Halstead, 1967).","Mature adults ascend rivers during spring and early summer  when water temperature ranges from 10-18C and gather in small groups. Behavioural experiments suggest that mature sea lampreys can smell the presence of ammocoetes and use this as a guide to functional spawning grounds. Spawning occurs in fast-flowing highly oxygenated areas with gravel, pebbles and sand bottoms. Females release small eggs (< 1 mm diameter) in nests exclusively built by males, which have been observed to reach the spawning grounds first . Spawning takes place mostly during sunny days, when water temperature is at least 15C. Ammocoetes hatch after 7-14 days (41851,  88186 ). Successful hatching requires water temperatures of 15-25C. Ammocoetes develop in freshwater and migrate to the sea after metamorphosis.

Occurs in lakes and rocky runs and pools of small to large rivers.  Some landlocked populations exist. Found in all rivers where temperature rises above 10 C for about 3 months per year and does not exceed 20 C for more than a few weeks in summer (preferred temperatures 4-12C). Juveniles may live in cold lakes in northern Europe. Parr (i.e. juveniles) are territorial and are found in the upper reaches of rivers and streams, in riffle areas with strong current and rough gravel bottoms. During winter, parr seek refuge in small spaces or under stones during the day (Refs.  59043 , 89461). Young remain in freshwater for 1 to 6 years, then migrate to coastal marine waters or even to open oceans where they remain for 1 to 4 years before returning to freshwater  for spawning. Adults inhabit cooler waters with strong to moderate flow. The Atlantic salmon is reported to live up to 10 years, but most individuals only reach 4-6 years. Juveniles feed mainly on aquatic insects, mollusks, crustaceans and fish; adults at sea feed on squids, shrimps, and fish. Most populations depend mostly or exclusively on stocking due to degradations of environmental conditions.  Fishing pressure on wild stocks has decreased due to intensive farming but other problems have increased. Farmed salmons escape in large numbers and move to any river and hybridize with wild stocks. This species may hybridize with trout (Salmo trutta). Diseases of the species include furunculosis (Aeromonas salmonicida), corynebacterial kidney disease (Renibacterium salmoninarum), enteric red mouth disease (Yersinia ruckeri), infectious pancreatic necrosis virus, bacterial kidney disease, fin rot and fungus infections. Marketed fresh, dried or salted, smoked, and frozen; eaten steamed, fried, broiled, cooked in microwave, and baked.","At the onset of sexual maturity this species is known to return from the ocean to the river where it was born, and even to its specific natal site (Refs.  7471 ,  51442 ). Lacustrine populations move to tributaries. Spawning migration into freshwater lasts from June to November. Spawns at 6-10C in gravel river areas far upstream with moderate to fast-flowing, well-oxygenated waters and a succession of riffles and pools (Refs.  6390 ,  59043 ). The female selects a site where the gravel is of the right size and of sufficient depth (0.1 to 0.3 m) (Refs.  7471 ,  51442 ) and water depth is around 0.5-3 m. The female digs a depression (""redd"") by turning on her side and flexing her body up and down, without touching the stones. This species spawns in pairs. The male guards and defends the female against other males. A female releases between 8,000-25,000 eggs during a spawning season ; 500 to 2000 per kg. Fertilized eggs sink into the redd and are covered with a layer of gravel (0.1-0.3 m) usually by the male (Refs.  7471 ,  59043 ). Females are also observed to cover the eggs. Individual spawning is completed in 2-3 days after a female digging several redds and spawning with several males. Period of spawning lasts for 1-2 weeks. Most males die after spawning, while 10-40% of females may survive and return to the sea in autumn or overwinter in rivers, feed one summer, and migrate again. They may spawn in the year following the first reproduction or may remain at sea for 18 months before returning once more to the river. Of the returning females, about 0.3-6 % spawn a second time and very few spawn a third or fourth time. In short rivers with presumably less exhaustive upstream migration, up to 34% of returning individuals spawn a second time; some individuals may spawn for up to six seasons. Eggs hatch in spring, usually after 70-160 days. Upon hatching, alevins (i.e. newly-hatched young up to 1 month) are negatively phototactic and move deeper into the gravel (Refs. 58137,  59043 ). As their yolk sac is absorbed, the fry emerge from the bottom and move to shallow riffles just downstream of their redd. Mortality of young individuals during the first months may range from 14-61 %. Parr (i.e. juveniles) may remain in freshwater environments for 1-7 years (depending on temperature and feeding conditions) but most stay for 2-3 years. Parr undergo morphological and physiological changes called smoltification which prepares them for life in the sea. At the southern end of their range, many reach a length of 12-15 cm, transform into smolts and are ready for migration in spring of the first year after hatching (Refs.  7471 ,  51442 ). At the northern end of the range they may take 5-6 years to reach smolt stage. Smolts move towards estuaries, the continental shelf and eventually the open ocean. The Atlantic salmon matures between 3-7 years. After 1-4 years at sea, it migrates back to the upper reaches of its natal river to spawn (Refs.  59043 ,  89461 ). It has an acute sense of smell and it is suggested that it imprints a sequence of odours while inhabiting rivers and during its smolt run. It presumably reverses this sequence to return to its natal site. Several studies have shown that smolt runs are strongly correlated to increasing water temperature and water flow during spring.There is little evidence of natural spawning by land-locked populations of Atlantic salmon in Australia, and populations are maintained by stocking .",Lower Risk: least concern (LR/lc) ; Date assessed:  01 August 1996,3--4,9--15,3--4,7--11,58--61," Distinguished from congeners by having the following unique characters: 10-13 scales between end of adipose base and lateral line; 17-24 gill rakers; caudal fin deeply forked in individuals smaller than 20 cm SL; hyaline or grey adipose margin; posterior part of vomer toothless Mouth extends only to area below rear of eye and has well developed teeth Vomerine teeth weak Caudal fin with 19 rays Little scales Juveniles have 8-12 blue-violet spots on the flanks with little red spots in-between Adults at sea are bluish-green dorsally becoming silvery along the sides and white ventrally; with a few black spots but none under lateral line (Ref  37032 , Ref  51442 ) Caudal fin usually unspotted and adipose fin not black bordered During reproduction individuals lose the silvery shine and become dull brown or yellowish Males may be mottled with red or have large black patches (Refs  37032 ,  51442 , 88171) Skin becomes thick and leathery Survivors lose their spawning coloration and are generally dark in colour During the spawning season, males are characterized by elongated hooked jaws that meet at the tips, thicker fins, and slime covering their body Hook of males dwindle after spawning.",Harmless,1.5,9.3,15.3,1857,0.5,0.01047,3.02,"Medium, minimum population doubling time 1.4 - 4.4 years (K=0.1-0.2; tmax=6; Fecundity=1,600).",0.39,High vulnerability (62 of 100) .,Very high,de

Adults undergo diel vertical migration and ascend into the epipelagic zone at night.  Juveniles have been captured at night within 175 m from the surface, while the remains of a large specimen (50 kg) were taken from the stomach of the bottom-living shark, Centroscymnus coelolepis, caught on a bottom-set longline at 1,246 m.  A mature female of 1.4 m mantle length had 250,000 ovarian eggs.  Observations on bioluminescence from living animals verified a rapid flash response from the arm tip photophores, as a startling or warning function, and a steady glow from the visceral photophores as is common for protective counter illumination.  In situ video footage reveals it to be a strong swimmer, both forward and backward, propelled by its huge fins, and changes directions quickly by bending its body.  Observed attack on a bait rig showed speeds of 7.2 to 9 km/h and emission of short, bright flashes from its 2 arm-tip photophores before it attacked. It also emits long and short intermittent glows when swimming around the lighted bait rig.

Maximum mantle length of both sexes is the same, 100 cm, possibly to 130 cm .  Maximum depth from Ref. 104455. An oceanic species .  Occupies epipelagic to upper mesopelagic depths, and undergoes diel vertical migrations.  Cosmopolitan, common circumglobal inhabitant of warm tropical and subtropical open waters, only rarely approaching the shelf zone.  Avoids the oligotrophic central waters of the open ocean.  Also reaches higher latitudes into temperate boreal and notalian regions, transported by warm currents, e.g. the Tsushima, Kuroshio, Agulhas, Brazil Currents and the Gulf Stream.  Not an active swimmer during most of its life cycle, rather, it propels itself slowly by gentle undulation of its long, broad, diamond-shaped fins.  However,  is capable of a powerful reactive jet of short duration when threatened.  Such low-energy life style promotes
 very high growth rates, among the highest of all squids. By the age of 300 days, may  reach 800 mm mantle length and 17.5 kg body weight.  Males reach maturity mainly at 400 to 550 mm mantle length (age 170 to 200 days), and females mature at 550 to 650 mm mantle length (age 230 to 250 days).  Life span is 1 year.  Spawning lasts throughout the year in tropical waters and during the warm season in peripheral regions.  Spawning is intermittent, with multiple fillings and evacuations of the oviducts.  Mating occurs in
the ""head to head"" position.  The social organization is unique among squids:  consists of pairs formed of same-sized males and females that occur at an immature stage of less than 100 mm mantle length, and probably remain together constantly during their lifetimes (monogamy).  Small schools of pairs may be locally common.  Arm length and probably the anal photophore play the key role in pair formation in immature squids.  Juveniles feed on crustaceans, small cephalopods and fishes in subsurface waters,  but subadults and adults feed mainly in daytime in deep-water layers mostly from 400 to 650 m on dense concentrations of non-active midwater fishes.  Predators include different species of ommastrephid squids, dolphin fish, lancet fish, various species of tuna, swordfish, Gempylus serpens, sharks and mammals (e.g. dolphins, rough-toothed dolphin, false killer whale, sperm whale).  Valued for its firm and flavorful flesh, its high commercial value makes it an important target species along the coastal waters of the Sea of Japan and around Okinawa . During copulation, female and male mate in a head-to-head position.  The male transfers its spermatophores to the female via the hectocotylus, which attaches to the surface of the female's buccal membrane.  Spawning occurs throughout the year, in tropical waters during summer and early autumn, and lasts for 2-3 months.  During spawning, females first produce a secretion of the nidamental glands like that of the ommastrephid","During copulation, female and male mate in a head-to-head position.

Gametes are spawned through the metanephridia or body wall rupturing (termed as ""epitoky"", wherein a pelagic, reproductive individual, ""epitoke"", is formed from a benthic, nonreproductive individual, ""atoke"").  After fertilization, most eggs become planktonic; although some are retained in the worm tubes or burrowed in jelly masses attached to the tubes (egg brooders).  Life Cycle:  Eggs develop into trocophore larva, which later metamorph into juvenile stage (body lengthened), and later develop into adults .","Members of the class Polychaeta are mostly gonochoric (sexual).

Life cycle:  Embryos hatch into planktonic stage and live for some time before they grow larger and take up a benthic existence as adults.",Not Evaluated,,,,,,,,2.3,8.4,14,1188,,,,,,,Medium,ca

Adults are opportunistic feeders, known to forage for their food from the surface to the bottom over a wide depth range.  Feed mainly on fishes (Atlantic mackerel, barracudinas, silver hake, redfish, herring and lanternfishes; also on crustaceans and squids.  They use their sword to kill their prey.  Large individuals may accumulate large percentages of mercury in its flesh.  Are batch spawners.  Spawning takes place in Atlantic during spring in southern Sargasso Sea.  Migrate to cooler waters to feed.  Females grow fastest.  Determination of age is difficult since the otoliths are very small and scales are missing in adults.  Year rings have been successfully counted on cross sections of the fin rays.  Pelagic eggs measure 1.6-1.8mm and the newly hatched larvae is 4 mm long.  Sword is well developed at a length of 10mm and young live pelagically in the upper water layers where they quickly develop into very voracious predators.
