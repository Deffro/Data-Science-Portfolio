"awesome sound quality. pros 7-8 hrs of battery life (including 45 mins approx call time)Awesome sound output. Bass and treble are really very clear without equaliser.

I received a quick delivery from flipkart. The headphones are light weight and foldable which makes it easy to carry. Sound quality is decent. Bluetooth connectivity is very good. The only negetive aspect of this device is the call quality. It's terrible. You can hear the other person but the microphone on this device is so poor that you won't be audible on the other end. It definitely doesn't support handsfree calling. I tried using the cable to call but again it didn't improve much. This is...READ MORE,3

Hi guys I recently brought these headphone and have been using it for a while now. The headphones are just decent for the price range. I got it for under 1000 bucks. The optimal sound can be achieved through equilizer only. Pairing it is fairly easy. Battery is also decent. The ear puffs are not too comfortable. A little bigger and softer puffs would have been great. The build quality is also fairly decent. The only issue I faced was with the microphone. Others were not able to hear me proper...READ MORE,3

Bought this headphone on 16 June 2020. It's been a few days I've been using it. So far the battery backup is superb in this price segment.

Writing this review after 9 days of usage:-The sound quality is rich and impressive along with the bass that makes you feel that you are in the music. Noise cancellation is also great.

Overall a great headphone to consider at this price range. Great job done by Boat and thanks to flipkart.READ MORE,5

Good product as it's price. Sound quality is good too but i experienced some issues after using it for few months. Whenever i watch a video the sound goes mute and i have to rewind the video to unmute it. It gives an extra wire for the headphone along with the usb. Design is rocking and well built. Keys are okay but can be improved a little bit. And battery life is good but it starts draining frequently after a little long use.READ MORE,4

"Well after using it for 6 months now, Its worth in Rs 999. Sound quality is pretty good, looks are also good. Although it was a bit tight on ears initially but now i would say it has loosened up to fit the comfort level. It's sound is actually good. But Bluetooth range is bad, it looses connection once u get out of room and mic also doesn't work properly sometimes. But if you are getting it for INR 1000 should go for it. Although can compare it with mivi headphones.READ MORE",4

Review after using it for a while-1. Sound Quality- 3/5Not the best sound at this price point. I'm an audiophile & a music producer so I've tried lots of headphones. Sounds are a bit muffled. Low frequencies are boosted so better base. Mid are boosted a little so voice parts are loud. But higher frequencies are very low. Unless you use an equilizer you might not get the best experience. Mic is also average. Capturing strength isn't that great. You might have to shout while talking. Compared...READ MORE,3

Good Head Phone with better sound quality and built design is so simple and comfortable to use but I feel that if they provided separate buttons for volume up /down and next/previous and make multifunction button into separate button.

Headphones are of great quality build wise and if one needs to hit nirvana while traveling. Somehow the option of using the headphones with Wire is not as pleasant of a listening experience as it is with the BT. When used with BT for making calls people often complained about them not being able to listen to what I was saying. the microphone isn't good enough.READ MORE,4

The sound quality is very good. But it's hard to wear it for to long as the ear pads are little bit hard compared to the other headphones. As the ear pads are made by some clothe like material the skin pealing off is not there..       But you guys should note one thing is that the neon color is really stylish and cool but it gets dirty really fast that the green color turn brownish black.So the black color one might be the best option as it would always clean..But it will not be as stylish a...READ MORE,4

The Boat Rockerz 400 have awesome bass and superb balanced sound quality.Great Battery backup as it's been 7 days I am using without single charge (I had not used continuously for not more than 3 hours)and it shows 60% battery charge.My friends while listening also said it's great value for money with incredible sound quality.The most important part the Boat Rockerz 400 is it supports synced calling while you are on call or listening to song.I recommend to buy it.READ MORE,4
"Best headset for this price,  but one thing this product is not suitable for pubg or free fire by Bluetooth but perfect by using Aux cable got it.If u want to play pubg by Bluetooth better to buy headset price in between 3k - 4k and lot of pressure to ears even for 30 mins better to buy deep-in earphones.This is the honest review of boat headset 400😊READ MORE",5

Clear sound with moderate trable  and bass. Noise cancellation is very effective and volume is high enough to make you feel the solitude in crowded areas. Battery back up is excellent charges quickly.Only demerit is the mic which is in the right ear piece. You will have to raise your voice to be able to speak.READ MORE,4

"One of the best product in this price range. Good sound quality and even better bass. And the fact that you can use it with the aux if you are low on battery is really great.

"I am satisfied with this purchase. I  made up my mind to buy it after testing it personally and taking feedback from two of my collegues. Sound quality and bass is commendable at the price Rs999 I bought it for. The connectivity range of Bluetooth with the headphones as per my test was about 8m and beyond it you begin to feel the distortions. The two draw backs I found in my headphones were : 1. Pads could be softer ; 2. Slight scratchy sound are heard while speaking to someone, though the mo...READ MORE",4

I am writing this review after 1 week of usage.The product is good for first time users. Sounds is good and built quality is okay. If you are thinking to play PUBG then you won't be able to play.

At last it is good for normal usage.READ MORE,4

"Headphone ear cup pads are not that much comfortable. It is made of fine quality. Ears starts to sweat and pain when used for longer period of time. Other issue, microphone doesn't work when connected to bluetooth, for that you need to disconnect it first and then plug wire to use it(mic) like when you are receiving calls which is really disturbing! Best alternative to this is Moto Pulse which I have used, most of the things between both are of same quality but Moto is more comfortable.READ MORE",3

Packaging was good. As usual ontime delivery by Flipkart. Regarding the product it's best out there in the market for its price. The only Con is ears start to pain after an hour or so. The cushion on the earpods is good. The build quality is topnotch for the price point. It comes with 3.5mm audio jack as well. In case you run out of battery you can always rely on the conventional wire setup and continue your journey of listening to music :) Over all a great product for 1.4k.READ MORE,4

There are two shortcomings: The MIC isn't very good. The headphones aren't adjustable sideways hence are very tight and it's starts paining after 15 minutes. Overcoming these issues will make it a perfect 5* product.READ MORE,4

At a price of 1k superb sound quality. Nice bass. I have compared the product with boat 430. 400 has better sound quality at a lesser price. When it comes to design 430 has a better hand.

Products build quality is just average. Particularly speaking the audio out put is not great. Its just average. Dont even think about those highs and lows. Its not pleasent to listen.u cant use this device more than half an hour. In my opinion save some more bucks and buy a better one. Though the connectivity is very fast. Even the ear pads are very small. U wont get a comfortable feel if u have big ears. Finally.  Less price is not giving a good product. So better buy a costly one.READ MORE,3

"I shouldn't have given any ratings. But, for sound quality, I'm giving 1 star.Ears are starting to hurt after 10 minutes of usage. Poor build quality.

"I am using this product since 8 months.. I deliberately chose to review it so late.. Wanted to see the battery backup consistency.. And it's damn good.. Can't say it's the best in the market in terms of battery backup but it's an all rounder.. I have used it while jogging, sleeping and even in the washroom.. Just one thing that bugged me is the bluetooth range.. Reasonable but could have been better.READ MORE",4

"5 star to Flipkart for fast delivery. 3 star to the product. Overall build quality is ok but power and volume button looks very cheap. I fear that anything these buttons can come out. This headphone can be used as wireless and wired. Box has aux cable. When connected through bluetooth with laptop, you can hear lot of noise. Noise disappears as soon as you switch to wired mode. Battery backup is ok. I expected better performance from this product.READ MORE",3
I have used this for the last whole month and I am not happy with it. these headsets have a big problem that is they hurt my ears.After wearing it for 20 mins my ear starts sweating and its painful.the clamping force is very ecess.in case of sound also this is not that great.the bass is very excessive that the mids and the vocals are not at all clear and for me its a trash/the build quality is top notch in this price range nothing can touch it .But the bluetooth connectivity is also dissappoi...READ MORE,3

"Headphones are from a reputed brand. Sound quality is good and battery backup is ok, but build quality is not good. They feel very flimsy and light as they are completely made of plastic. They are also a bit uncomfortable on the ears. You might experience some pain in the beginning while using it. The pain will reduce but they still feel uncomfortable while wearing them. I gave 3 stars only because of sound quality, because their build quality is bad. I have been using their other model boat ...READ MORE",3

Go for it blindly. The sound quality will mesmerize you. Dont go by the naysayers. Those complaining about the tightness have probably never used a headphone before. It is bound to be a little tight else it will fall off your head. Regarding the sound clarity it is clear and crisp. The bass is thumpingly good. What else do you expect in 999?READ MORE,5

They produce continuous cracked beep sound when used on Bluetooth on low volume or when there is drops in the songs.Headphones are good but are little tight on ears and can become uncomfortable if used for long period of time. Build quality is not that much great. and the AUX cable and usb are of very low quality. I think the Aux cable had been changed bcoz it didn't have boAt branding.READ MORE,2

"it interferes with wifi  basically, if your mobile is connected with wifi and also with the headphone via Bluetooth then you might not get the proper wifi speed because both use similar microwave frequency so  we get slow internet speed and if you want to watch youtube video using wifi then it might buffer on higher resolutionsound wise its good doesn't have much noise cancellation in it but it has a good battery backupREAD MORE",3

"Review After 48 HoursIn the last 48 hours I have used this headphone for around 15-20 hours and the battery is still 30% left at the time of writing this review so for battery I would rate 5/5. Sound quality is also good, treble and bass are balanced so its Yes for normal users. For EDM lovers I would recommend to go for some other headphone as it may not give the desired output(especially bass). Overall I would give this headphone 4/5 stars.READ MORE",4

Noise cancellation has a wierd high frequency sound and sometimes it mutes audio as it detects the entire audio as noise.. This is happening on a daily basis. The sound quality while using aux cable is pretty good.. Not disappointed but the noise cancellation. Is irritating as it keeps playing high frequency sound with whatever audio you try to listen..READ MORE,3

"Bought the product to attend the online classes. Within 2 months, one side stopped working, but that was taken care by the Boat company n was rectified. The major issue with the headset is the MIC. I cant walk n talk, as the other person wont hear my voice, i need to hold my phone and use the MIC of the phone only than the other person is able to hear me. For me, this ends the concept of Bluetooth headset, if i am unable to use the headset without holding the phone..READ MORE",2

Was a bit worried as I have seen a lot of people saying its not comfortable to use for long intervals. But it wasn't the case with me though. And very happy about it. But obviously they are not the most comfortable pair of headphones too. Bass is good. Sound not very clear. But good for the price. Though I expected a bit better. Battery and build satisfactory. As my first concern is sound always. Not gonna buy them for 1499 for sure. Got them for 1099. Happy... .READ MORE,4

For this price range that I bought(1099) this headphone is beastAnd The Bass is so heavy and built and Connection and Battery is awesome.But the Vocals are suppressed because of heavy base when you listen Melody songs...So if you are Melody songs lover than go for another options(JBL are best for Melody) but if you are a bass lover than definitely you love this. And Rocking music Pop music and Dance music this will be the best option.And the noice cancellation is also very good as they gi...READ MORE,5

Based on my personal experience.I bought this headphone on Big billion day. It's working very nice having good sound with base.

1.Excellent for online games like PUBG( no sound lag and latency problem found at  all after playing for 6 months)2. Sound Quality is heavenly...3.

The headset provides the best bass experience in it's budget range (INR 999/-) and the battery backup is top notch as wellThe cons would be the poor quality of in-built microphone and its build quality which diminishes its charm after a few prolonged hours of use. So these headphones aren't much suitable for a heavy gaming profile but do offer the best quality bass experience (sound quality is normal).READ MORE,4

Honest Review:I bought it for 1399/- and loved it as it looks premium and easy to carry since it's foldable. I Love the Quality Of sound it produces. But it hurts my ears as it too tight initially (might get elastic with time). The bass and music quality is excellent and i feel it is the best under 1.5k rupees.For Initial impression Check my YouTube chanel @TechTalksREAD MORE,4

Writing this review after using the months. The product has really good sides according to budget but there are some drawbacks that sometimes causes nuisance.Pros: 1. Sound quality is really good . During calls audio comes with very good clarity.2. Bass is standard and makes you really groove along with your playlist3. Takes 2-3 hours for charging full. And with moderate use the battery can lay up to 6-8 hours.4. Even if you don't have charge aux cable is there to plug in and voila you'r...READ MORE,3

"I've used this product for a year now. sounds, battery backup, charging are simply amazing. The only issue i faced about is the wire. It gets damaged every time you plug in and out.

I'm writing this part today, it broke.READ MORE",4

It's very rigid on the ears, it's like constant pressure on ears. Just feel like removing within few minutes. The reason is they designed such a way that we cannot adjust the headset from top, but only on ears, this leaves no room for relaxation on ears.

"It's sound & bass is good but in terms of functionality it has none! For example:1. (Simply, don't pair it with more than one device.)     Explanation: Let's say your boAt Rockerz 400 are paired  up with two devices both have Bluetooth on. Both will try to connect and you cannot disconnect them via your headphones.

"I've been using the headphones for the last 3 months and have faced no issues so far. Does what it is supposed to do. The sound quality is good. It gives about 4 hours battery backup. The only issue i have faced is regarding call connectivity. The mic is not good. The other person on the line usually have trouble listening to you.

This product is value for money but the built quality is slightly lower than expected because when you strech it high   some cracks are formed at head side plastic region. Then otherwise it is an average product . Sound quality is adequate no more bass but volume level is very high . I bought  it at rs-999 at flipkart sale and it's very good at this price range but at 1499 you should go to another best headphones.READ MORE,4

"The Product Is Good..But The Microphone quality and Bluetooth Receiver is not much good..The Sound Quality is amazing..Bass Was very very good..Delivery Was Very Late but during these times, it is quite acceptable..I got the product for 999 which is Worth..But for 1499, It is not that much worth..If they have given a quality microphone it is good for the price..Therefore My Rating Is 4 Star Out Of 5 Star..READ MORE",4

"I am reviewing this product after 2 months of usage. The bass is very good, build quality was good. But it causes little pain during your initial days of wearing it.Cons - There is difference between quality of audio when heared using Bluetooth and when using wired.READ MORE",5
"Another good product by Boat! Good built, light weight and most importantly crispy sound. Works great even if you are using it without Bluetooth, just attaching wire. However the buttons are too sensative I feel. Unknowingly I touch them and it just change the song or jump to the another video directly. Otherwise no flaw! Good product.READ MORE",4

Believe me First you will hate the quality of headphone as they will be very much tight in your ear and you will think of buying other headphones but believe me never take this decision .After few days of use you will think you have got the best out of you 15k budget.
